# <Password Generator>

## Description
This challenge was provided to demonstrate our ability to work with javascript in creating a password generator as a part of the Adelaide UNiversity Web Development Bootcamp. It was important to make this password generator responsive to the user's inputs and requirements and therefore asks what length the user would like their password to be and then whether they would like to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers or special characters to their password. This program also checks to make sure all requested characters are within the generated password before providing it. 

Through this project I utilised functions, objects, object methods, for loops and conditional statements to produce my end result. It was especially useful to organise key values and functions using the object type. 

Please find the finished project here:

## Usage
To use this program simply click the 'Generate Password' button and follow the prompts that appear at the top of the screen. Once completed your password of desired length and characters should appear within the text box for you to copy. 

If you dislike the password and wish to regenerate it, re-click the 'Generate Password' button and choose whether you would like to use the same parameters for the password generation or reset them. You password will then be regenerated.
